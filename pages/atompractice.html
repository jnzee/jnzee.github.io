        The world is a beautiful place <br> to be born into <br> if you don't mind happiness <br> not always being <br> so very much fun <br> if you don't mind a touch of hell <br> now and then <br> just when everything is fine <br> because even in heaven
        <br> they don't sing <br> all the time <br>

    <div class="box box2">
      <p>
        The world is a beautiful place <br> to be born into <br> if you don't mind some people dying <br> all the time <br> or maybe only starving <br> some of the time <br> which isn't half bad <br> if it isn't you <br>

        Oh the world is a beautiful place<br> to be born into<br> if you don't much mind <br> a few dead minds <br> in the higher places <br> or a bomb or two <br> now and then <br> in your upturned faces <br> or such other improprieties <br> as our Name
        Brand society <br> is prey to <br> with its men of distinction <br> and its men of extinction <br> and its priests <br> and other patrolmen <br>
      </p>

    <div class="box box4">
      <p>
        and its various segregations <br> and congressional investigations <br> and other constipations <br> that our fool flesh <br> is heir to <br>

        Yes the world is the best place of all <br> for a lot of such things as <br> making the fun scene <br> and making the love scene <br> and making the sad scene <br> and singing low songs and having inspirations <br> and walking around <br> looking
        at everything <br> and smelling flowers <br> and goosing statues <br> and even thinking <br> and kissing people and <br> making babies and wearing pants <br> and waving hats and <br> dancing <br> and going swimming in rivers <br> on picnics <br>        in the middle of the summer <br> and just generally <br> 'living it up' <br> Yes <br> but then right in the middle of it <br> comes the smiling <br>
